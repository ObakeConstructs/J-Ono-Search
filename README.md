# J-Ono
A simple, open-source tool for searching against the J-Ono collection of Japanese onomatopoeic and mimetic sound words.

### Update
* Moved to ObakeConstructs Org
* "Kana Picker" added to search page
* Additional definitions are being added daily, but we're only adding those for which we have good representative sample images.
