# J-Ono
A simple, open-source tool for searching against the J-Ono collection of Japanese onomatopoeic and mimetic sound words.

### Recent Updates
* "Kana Picker" added to search page
* Additional definitions are being added daily, but we're only adding those for which we have good representative sample images
* JSON Record structure updated to better handle multiple definitions
* Added URL searching parameters and redirecting index files to help with Google searches (I think).
* Updated again to vastly improve load time
* Moved to j-ono.com (pending ssl certs)
